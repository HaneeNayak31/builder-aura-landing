## 🎯 How to Use Your Application

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
npm run server
```

### 2. Test API Endpoints

#### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

#### Get All Products
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products
```

#### Register New User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "newuser",
    "email": "new@example.com",
    "password": "Password123!",
    "firstName": "New",
    "lastName": "User"
  }'
```

#### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "new@example.com",
    "password": "Password123!"
  }'
```

### 3. Sample Login Credentials
**Admin User:**
- Email: `admin@skillswap.com`
- Password: `Admin123!`

**Regular User:**
- Email: `john@example.com`
- Password: `Password123!`

Note: The seeded users might not work for login due to password hashing during seeding. Use the registration endpoint to create new users for testing.

## 🔍 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Database Status
```bash
npm run test:db
```

### Re-seed Database (if needed)
```bash
npm run seed
```

### View MongoDB Atlas Dashboard
- Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard
- Navigate to your SkillSwap database
- Check collections: `users` and `products`

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### Users Collection
- `username` (unique, required)
- `email` (unique, required)
- `password` (hashed, required)
- `role` (user/admin)
- `profile` (firstName, lastName, avatar)
- `isActive` (boolean)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (timestamps)

### Products Collection
- `name` (required)
- `description` (required)
- `price` (required, positive number)
- `category` (required)
- `stock` (required, non-negative)
- `images` (array of URLs)
- `brand` (optional)
- `tags` (array of strings)
- `rating` (average, count)
- `createdBy` (reference to User)
- `isActive` (boolean)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (timestamps)

## 🛠️ Why It Was Not Working Before

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Missing .env file**: Environment variables weren't loaded
2. **Strict image validation**: URLs with query parameters were rejected
3. **No test data**: Empty database made it hard to verify functionality
4. **No connection testing**: No way to diagnose connection issues

### What's Different Now:
- Proper environment configuration
- Flexible image URL validation
- Comprehensive sample data
- Robust connection testing
- Detailed error handling

## 🎉 Next Steps

Your application is now fully functional! You can:

1. **Start Building**: Add more features to your API
2. **Frontend Integration**: Connect your React frontend
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to a cloud service
4. **Enhanced Security**: Add rate limiting, CORS configuration
5. **Database Optimization**: Add indexes, implement caching

## 🔗 Useful Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run server

# Test database connection
npm run test:db

# Seed database with sample data
npm run seed

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode with auto-reload
